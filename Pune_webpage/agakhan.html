                    Aga Khan Palace, an iconic landmark in Pune, Maharashtra, is a significant monument of Indian history. Built in 1892 by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III, the palace served as a source of employment for the famine-stricken villagers in the surrounding areas. The palace is renowned for its role during India's freedom struggle, as it was used to intern Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, and his secretary Mahadev Desai during the Quit India Movement in 1942</p>
